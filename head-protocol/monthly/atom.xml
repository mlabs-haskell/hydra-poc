initializes its state
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#621</a>. See the PR
description for details. This did not strictly happen this month, but we have
not mentioned it last time. </p></li><li><p><strong>Closed first gap in Head Contract</strong>: We collected gaps between specification
and current implementation in
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#452</a> and started now
closing them. This first issue, was to prevent DoS / stalling of heads, by
bounding the lower and upper transaction validity time of the <code>close</code>
transaction. As always, time handling is hard and this required detailed
discussion in the form of an ADR. See
<a href="https://hydra.family/head-protocol/adr/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ADR21</a> for more details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced cost of commits</strong> by at least <strong>30%</strong> using reference scripts also
in the <code>commit</code> transaction. We only used reference scripts in <code>abort</code> so far.
This reduces the min ADA cost of <code>commit</code> because the transactions are roughly
5.2KB smaller.</p><p>Before:

to Cicero for a nix-based CI, we started using nix flakes for <code>nix build</code> and
<code>nix develop</code> instead of the legacy <code>nix-shell</code> in
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#646</a>. While we ended up
sticking with Github Actions as the only CI and a Cachix cache, we extended
this work to build our docker images more efficiently using <code>nix</code> in
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/pull/654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#654</a>.</p><p>Image sizes went down between 20-50%:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/head-protocol/assets/images/2022-12-docker-images-bc1665869d91e36b30b5191f084e141a.png" width="1552" height="244"></p><p>While docker CI builds on <code>master</code> went down to 1-10min (from 10-30m+)!</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="hydra-v1-specification">Hydra V1 Specification<a class="hash-link" href="#hydra-v1-specification" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Finally, we bit the bullet and started a write-up of the specification. Over the
last couple of months we had worked with marked up versions (see below) of the
original paper and a GDoc to discuss and review the protocol as it was
implemented.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/head-protocol/assets/images/2022-12-marked-up-paper-5354284a6ca23c01b74593af47a94fa2.png" width="707" height="540"></p><p>As we also updated the security properties and proofs, we started aggregating a
LaTeX document on overleaf. While it holds a similar background and
preliminaries as the original paper, it only specifies a single version of the
protocol with no variants, less modularization, as well as explicit assumptions
and important notes for implementors.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/head-protocol/assets/images/2022-12-spec-overleaf-36d2b23cfb2f8931a3e4200623041da1.png" width="1577" height="689"></p><p>We aim to be publishing the spec as part of the main <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hydra repository</a> soon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="community">Community<a class="hash-link" href="#community" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Hydra for Payments project</strong> completed the first phase of this work stream
by tagging version <a href="https://github.com/obsidiansystems/hydra-pay/releases/tag/v0.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0.1.0</a>.
This open source project conducted by Obsidian Systems and sponsored by IOG
created a great starting point for developers to build services/APIs of
payment channels using Hydra Head. This month we reviewed the improved
documentation and are looking forward to see this work applied to eventually
build fast &amp; cheap payments for light-wallet users and power payment channel
use cases from business-to-business (B2B) in the short-term.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hydra for Voting project</strong> kicked off this joint project between IOG
Research, Catalyst &amp; Hydra Tribes, and the Cardano Foundation. The goal is to
assess suitability of Hydra Head to support voting use cases by implementing
parts of Catalyst voting system on Hydra Head and benchmark execution at
scale. The kick-off meeting took place on December 15.
</p></li><li><p><strong>Blog post by CF</strong>: To round off the year, Matthias wrote a nice
<a href="https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/hydra-head-protocol-an-open-source-solution-for-scalability/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">retrospective blog
post</a>
about Hydra at the CF. Besides summarizing our progress made in 2022 it also
gives an outlook where Hydra is headed for in 2023.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a class="hash-link" href="#conclusion" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Although Hydra is in essence an open source project right now, we would love to
make it "even more open source" in the coming months. Our vision of Hydra
requires to have the builders of the Cardano ecosystem to be part of this
journey. For that matter, we want not only to open up these monthly reports, but
the review meeting backing it as well!</p><p>This, besides our engagements with the community above, will allow the project
to grow beyond IOG &amp; CF contributions. To become the true Cardano open source
project we believe will be worthy to serve as the scalability component required
by the Cardano network.</p>]]></content>

been working on:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flaky TUI CI tests:</strong> We have sunk quite some time again in
investigating cryptic CI failures in our TUI end-to-end tests. They
have been crashing abruptly without any information and thus
hard-to-debug. This investigation was unsuccessful and we realized
at some point that the TUI tests are not that important anyways - we
have API-level end-to-end tests. So we disabled these tests for now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Published</strong> <code>hydra-cardano-api</code> <strong>to CHaP:</strong> With the Cardano
Haskell Packages (CHaP) becoming available now and wanting to be a
good citizen, we pushed for getting our flavor of the <code>cardano-api</code>
also published there. This is non-trivial though, as we are at an
integration point even "further up" than the <code>cardano-node</code>
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#504</a></p></li><li><p><strong>Implemented ADR18:</strong> While the first stints on persistence already
make it possible to restart <code>hydra-node</code> without needing to close a
Head, we have implemented this in a nicer way now only keeping a
single state (ground truth) for both L2 and L1 information
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/issues/541" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#541</a> of the Head protocol and the specification, we kept
discovering bigger and bigger issues and hence realized the need for
a discussion on transaction validity in context of closing /
contesting Heads. <a href="#615">#615</a></p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="formal-verification--specification">Formal verification &amp; specification<a class="hash-link" href="#formal-verification--specification" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>An important part of the project right now is the formalization and
audit preparation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Internal audit</strong> has started with involvement of two persons from IOG IT
team, each one addressing different part of Hydra:</p><ul><li>One auditor is working on the project as a whole, targeting
potential vulnerabilities with the off-chain code, the
infrastructure, dependencies, etc. This has not lead to any
significant issue nor action plan so far.</li><li>Another auditor is specifically targeting the formal
specification and the on-chain code to identify vulnerabilities
in the protocol itself.</li></ul></li><li><p>Discussions with researchers have led to the development of a joint Coordinated Hydra Head V1 specification defining formally the protocol as it is actually implemented.</p><ul><li>Work on this document has already allowed us to identify gaps</li><li>It is the basis on which BCryptic's analyst is working to audit Hydra protocol</li><li>It allows us to make explicit a lot of implicit assumptions that are in the code but not in the original paper and "Shape" the language used to describe the protocol</li></ul></li><li><p>We have drafted an RFP for submission to <strong>external</strong> auditors
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/audit/rfp/security/RFP.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra/blob/audit/rfp/security/RFP.md</a> defining the scope and targets of the audit</p></li><li><p>We are still unsure about whether our <strong>approach</strong> is the right one as having a "formal specification" in a manually checked document spanning a dozen pages seems quite brittle.</p><ul><li><p>Some progress has been made on "formalizing" properties to be automatically "QuickChecked" using an executable model of the expected behavior of the system but this approach seems more suited for "team-internal consumption", e.g. building confidence within the core committers and contributors</p></li><li><p>Ideally, we would want a proper formalization of the protocol, using an existing theorem proving/model checking framework, through which properties could be asserted. Quite a lot of work has already been done in blockchain space, including some work on Lightning and TLA+ or some other state-machine/temporal logic based language appear promising:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wecVT_4QDcU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wecVT_4QDcU</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/rberenguel/tla_lightning" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/rberenguel/tla_lightning</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-TLA-Planning-Driven-Development/dp/1484238281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.amazon.com/Practical-TLA-Planning-Driven-Development/dp/1484238281</a></li></ul></li><li><p>This effort should be done in accordance to the DApps certification process</p></li></ul></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="product">Product<a class="hash-link" href="#product" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Most updates on the product side of things have been addressed in the
starmap update above.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Hydra for Payments lighthouse project</strong>: Latest demonstration
shown by Obsidian Systems on how to use payment channels in a "light
way" from a web frontend. The API evolved and we were able to use
the <code>preview</code> testnet now. The project is progressing very nicely
and we are optimistic to close it successfully soon with improved
documentation and usability.</p></li><li><p><strong>NFT auctions lighthouse project:</strong> After doing surveys and
interviews, MLabs is currently concluding the discovery phase with a
light / white paper on how NFT auctions could be implemented using
Hydra (today or in the future with more features).</p></li><li><p><strong>Drafting Voting on Hydra project</strong>: Work has started on building a
Proof-of-concept for voting on Hydra targeting Catalyst’s use case but with an eye towards building a generic solution suitable for large scale voting systems based on Hydra Head</p><p>This development should be undertaken jointly with the Cardano Foundation and SundaeSwap who are also interested in building such a system and recently demonstrated their capacity of doing voting via the Cardano Summit voting system.</p></li><li><p><strong>TxPipe demonstrated integration with demeter.run:</strong> Without our
help nor even knowing of this effort, TxPipe has recently shown an
early prototype of <code>hydra-node</code>s instrumented via their
<a href="https://demeter.run" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">demeter.run</a> platform. This has come a bit as a surprise and is exactly why we love open source ❤️ → <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/c811360e60084f18ab9e9f16cc941432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video</a></p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="team--open-source">Team &amp; open source<a class="hash-link" href="#team--open-source" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Some notable developments this month have been:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Renamed the repository:</strong> from <strong>hydra-poc</strong> to
<a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>hydra</strong></a>! This was revealed in the summit presentation (see below) and should indicate that the project is not only a Proof of Concept (POC) anymore, but has become more - as also demonstrated by the various early adopters and demos lately. 🐲</p></li><li><p><strong>Inner source (IOG) contribution:</strong> The education team has been working on a Hydra Tutorial and we have been involved in reviewing and trying it out. This is a great effort and will help people get started with Hydra. Thanks folks 💚</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_mojV" id="cardano-summit--workshop">Cardano Summit &amp; workshop<a class="hash-link" href="#cardano-summit--workshop" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>This month there was also the Cardano Summit, this time organized by the
Cardano Foundation and the content was even voted on by the community!
We have been both, invited and nominated as panelist and speakers and
this makes us extremely proud! In general, the reception of Hydra seems
to be very positive in the community from what we could experience first
hand on the summit.</p><p>Agenda items we participated in:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://summit.cardano.org/agenda-day-1/best-of-blockchain-best-of-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best of blockchain, best of open source - Open Source panel </a> with IOG, CF &amp; TxPipe</p></li><li><p><a href="https://summit.cardano.org/agenda-day-2/cardano-ballot-speaker-winner-presentation-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cardano Ballot Speaker Winner: Dev Team</a> Introduction to Hydra and
reveal of the repository rename 🎉</p></li></ul><p>After attending the summit, we also used the fact that the whole team is
in one location for a team workshop. We booked a coworking space and
spent 3 days together. Not much coding &amp; hacking this time, but we are
happy to have produced these results:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Timeline / year in review:</strong> As we had new team members with us,
the request was to give a recap of how the Hydra project evolved
over the last two years. The whole timeline can bee seen below, and
this also sparked the idea of creating a "Year in review" blog post,
which is currently in preparation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retrospective</strong>: In-person workshops are the perfect place for
doing retrospectives to reflect on what was good, bad and collecting
ideas &amp; actions in how to improve our work environment and
processes.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/head-protocol/assets/images/2022-11-retro-110daa66ba7449f00dc091e80b65df51.png" width="4096" height="2155"></p><small><center>Retrospective board from 2022-11-22</center></small></li><li><p><strong>Impact map:</strong> Conscious about the fact that the project got defined about one year ago in a first project plan, and inspired by timeline and (short-term) ideas, we also set off to reflect on the <strong>Why</strong>, <strong>How</strong> and <strong>What</strong> of this project.</p><p>After reviewing the project vision, we reached for the tool of our choice to ideate on tangible objectives / deliverables - impact maps! Also, we felt the need to use a different goal this time. One that is reflecting more closely (or, in fact, broadly) what our current mission is. So instead of the <strong>% of Cardano transactions are done on L2</strong>, we set a new goal: being the <strong>number one DApp on Cardano</strong> (by all known metrics: TVL, traffic, volume etc..) Fundamentally, both goals illustrate the same idea, but the latter better supports the narrative that Hydra is also just a DApp (not a network upgrade) and needs usage &amp; adoption to reach our vision.</p><p>Below you see the result of our session. We checked back to the old impact map after creating this one, and many things are still relevant / similar on the new sample (it's never complete!) - some of the deliverables we even achieved.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="/head-protocol/assets/images/2022-11-impact-97ad611fd8b3395a70498f12d26703de.png" width="4096" height="3449"></p><small><center>Impact map with new goal</center></small></li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Reflecting on our original plans (about a year ago) and our current roadmap we can say we are behind our anticipated schedule. However, recent developments on the lighthouse projects and community members contributing &amp; using Hydra are convincing us that we are on the right track. The summit paints a similar picture and we feel reinvigorated by the great people we met, discussions we had and relationships we created &amp; solidified on the summit and during our Hydra workshop.</p>]]></content>
